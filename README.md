TODO: 

We need to autocomplete the rest of the patient file for a call in.

 If there is a alarming lab result patient should not have a chance to turn green again until the lab result has been at least ackowledges in the notes.

Semi should require a nurse to accept from waiting room (manual nurse doctor auto) spd -> speed

Dummy simulation (no colors or doctor/nurse inboxes) (dropdown for docbox or manual)

Chief complaint matches triage notes for some patients









Potential Ideas:

Use phone to detect heartbeat over the phone
Global dashboard to see predicted hospital waittimes
Doctor order suguries with voice
Marketplace agents
